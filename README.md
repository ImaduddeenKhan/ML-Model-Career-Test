Career Guidance Platform - Final Report
Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered career guidance platform that helps users discover suitable career paths based on their interests, skills, and preferences. The system uses machine learning to analyze user responses to a series of questions and provides personalized career recommendations along with insights and a downloadable PDF report.

Components Implemented
1. Machine Learning Model
Model Type: Classification model to predict career paths
Dataset: Synthetic career test data with 1000 records
Features: 10 questions about work preferences, problem-solving style, and personality traits
Target: Career categories (15 different career paths)
Models Tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVC)
Best Model: SVC with tuned hyperparameters (C=1, gamma='auto', kernel='rbf')
Performance: The model achieves moderate accuracy due to the limited feature set
2. Backend API (Flask)
Framework: Flask 3.1.0
Endpoints:
/api/questions: Returns the list of questions
/api/question: Returns the next question (with adaptive logic)
/api/predict: Processes answers and returns career predictions
/api/generate-pdf: Generates a PDF report with career guidance
Features:
Adaptive questioning based on previous answers
Career prediction with confidence scores
Personality type identification
Personalized insights generation
PDF report generation
3. Frontend UI
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Features:
Chat-style interface for interactive questioning
Multiple-choice question format
Real-time response processing
Animated transitions between questions
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Results display with career matches, personality insights, and career facts
PDF report download functionality
How to Use the Platform
Start the Test: Click the "Start Career Test" button on the homepage
Answer Questions: Respond to a series of questions about your preferences and skills
View Results: After completing the questions, the system will display:
Your personality type
Do's and don'ts for your career path
Top career matches with confidence percentages
Career facts and insights
Download Report: Click the "Download PDF Report" button to save a detailed guidance report
Technical Implementation Details
Machine Learning Pipeline
Data Preprocessing:

Categorical encoding of text responses
Feature scaling
Train/test split (80/20)
Model Selection:

Multiple models were evaluated (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC)
Performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
SVC was selected as the best performing model
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Grid search for optimal parameters
Best parameters: C=1, gamma='auto', kernel='rbf'
Backend Architecture
API Design:

RESTful endpoints for questions, predictions, and PDF generation
JSON response format
Stateless design for scalability
PDF Generation:

Uses FPDF library for PDF creation
Custom formatting for career guidance reports
Includes personality insights, career matches, and recommendations
Adaptive Questioning:

Questions adapt based on previous answers
Implements a simple rule-based system for question selection
Designed to gather the most relevant information efficiently
Frontend Design
UI/UX:

Chat-style interface for natural interaction
Animated transitions for better user experience
Mobile-responsive design
Clear visual hierarchy for results presentation
JavaScript Implementation:
